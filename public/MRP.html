<h1>The Best Movies According to Wiktor</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Avengers</h3>
<p>The movie has a very good balance of heroism and humour,
great characters' development, an interesting villain, great action-packed sequences</p>

<h3>Spider-Man-No way home</h3>
<p>A bigger, bolder Spider-Man sequel,
    No Way Home expands the franchise's scope and stakes without losing sight of its humor and heart </p>

<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>Francis Ford Coppola's crime saga follows the Corleone family in "The Godfather," "The Godfather, Part II" and "The Godfather, Part III."</p>
